Preface
*******
For more than a decade, the free and open source VuFind tool has been providing user-friendly access to information from libraries and other organizations. While the software has a supportive and friendly community and detailed online documentation, it has lacked a comprehensive introductory text to orient new users to its features and options. This book is designed to fill that gap, and help you become comfortable with this flexible application.

The book is divided into six parts:

•  Part 1 will help you understand the purpose of VuFind, install the software, and load some MARC records into it.
•  Part 2 will show you how to do some basic configuration and administration of the software.
•  Part 3 will show you how to customize the software’s look and feel.
•  Part 4 addresses non-MARC records: XML indexing and HTML crawling.
•  Part 5 discusses VuFind’s tools for combining different types of searches into a single interface.
•  Part 6 wraps up the book with some of the background necessary to do custom programming within the VuFind environment.

Most chapters are designed to be reasonably stand-alone and will refer back to relevant sections when necessary, so you can skip around and access content out of order if some topics are more relevant to your needs than others.
